<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3"><a href="https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/">Cookie clicker</a> is a game made by <a href="https://cookieclicker.fandom.com/wiki/Orteil">Orteil</a> which is played by clicking a cookie.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=4 data-line-end=5 ><a id="Buildings_4"></a>Buildings</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">After you gain enough cookies, you can buy <a href="https://cookieclicker.fandom.com/wiki/Building">buildings</a>, which cost cookies, but will give you some number of CpS (cookies per second), which differs by building.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=7 data-line-end=8 ><a id="Achievements_and_Upgrades_7"></a>Achievements and Upgrades</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">If you met a certain condition, for example if you have 100 farms, you get an <a href="https://cookieclicker.fandom.com/wiki/Achievement">achievement</a>. You also might unlock an upgrade, which costs cookies, but it helps you move on. For example, if you buy one cursor, you unlock an upgrade which costs 100 cookies, but the cursor’s CpS doubles and the CpC (cookies per click) doubles.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=10 data-line-end=11 ><a id="Shadow_Achievements_10"></a>Shadow Achievements</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="12">Some achievements are <a href="https://cookieclicker.fandom.com/wiki/Achievement#Shadow_Achievements">shadow achievements</a>, meaning that they are either unfair or very hard to get. For example, one shadow achievement has a 1/500000 (0.0002%) chance of appearing every second</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=13 data-line-end=14 ><a id="Golden_Cookies_13"></a>Golden Cookies</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15">Also, there are things called <a href="https://cookieclicker.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_Cookie">golden cookies</a>. They pop out of nowhere at first, and then fade out after. They look like this: <img src="https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/img/goldCookie.png" alt="">. If you click one before it fades out, you will get a random outcome that will always be good. For example, you might get a “Lucky!”, which gives you some number of cookies, or a “Frenzy”, which multiplies CpS by 7 for 77 seconds.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=16 data-line-end=17 ><a id="Milk_16"></a>Milk</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="17" data-line-end="18">Achievements also give you <a href="https://cookieclicker.fandom.com/wiki/Milk">milk</a>. You start with 0% milk and for every (non-shadow) achievement, you get 4% milk. If you have enough milk, you can get <a href="https://cookieclicker.fandom.com/wiki/Upgrades#Kitten_Upgrades">kitten upgrades</a>, which gives you more cps depending on how much like you have.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=19 data-line-end=20 ><a id="Sugar_Lumps_19"></a>Sugar Lumps</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="20" data-line-end="21">Once you baked at least 1 billion cookies, a <a href="https://cookieclicker.fandom.com/wiki/Sugar_Lump">sugar lump</a> will grow. Sugar lumps mature after 20 hours after they started growing, ripen after 23 hours, and fall and be auto-harvested after 1 day. If you click (harvest) a sugar lump when it’s mature, there will be a half chance it failed and so you get nothing, but there will be a half chance that it worked and you get 1 sugar lump. If you click (harvest) one while it is ripe, you will get 1 sugar lump. There is a chance you get a special sugar lump. A bifurcated sugar lump will spawn around 5% of the time, and will give you the normal 1 sugar lump half of the time, but will give you 2 sugar lumps the remaining half of the time. Also, around 0.5% of the time, you will get a caramelized sugar lump, which gives an equal chance of 1, 2, or 3 sugar lumps. They also have an added effect, that it refills sugar lump cooldowns in the minigames, which we will talk about later. Another type is called the golden sugar lump, which gives an equal chance of 2-7 sugar lumps, and has a small 0.075% of appearing. They have an additional effect that they double your number of cookies, and give you a buff which makes golden cookies spawn 10% more for the next a day. There is one last type that we will talk about later. You use sugar lumps for either leveling up your buildings or using them in minigames. Leveled up buildings give more CpS. For example, level 6 cursors give off 6% more CpS.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=22 data-line-end=23 ><a id="Ascending_22"></a>Ascending</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="23" data-line-end="24">You <a href="https://cookieclicker.fandom.com/wiki/Ascension">ascend</a> by pressing the “Legacy” button. If you ascend, all of your cookies will be converted to prestige and <a href="https://cookieclicker.fandom.com/wiki/Heavenly_Chips">heavenly chips</a>, which are added in a 1:1 ratio. Also, all of your cookies will be cleared and you will lose all upgrades. However, you will keep your achievements. Heavenly chips are used to buy <a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/cookieclicker/images/1/1a/AscensionTree.png/revision/latest?cb=20200102231556">heavenly upgrades</a>. For every prestige level, you get +1% CpS. For example, if you ascend and get 100 prestige levels, you get +100% CpS, or your CpS is doubled. Ascending also allows you to use a <a href="https://cookieclicker.fandom.com/wiki/Challenge_Mode">challenge mode</a>. There is currently only one challenge mode, and it is called “Born Again”. If you choose the challenge mode, the game acts like you just started the game and prestige levels and heavenly upgrades do not matter.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="26" data-line-end="27">After you get this upgrade, <a href="https://cookieclicker.fandom.com/wiki/Upgrades#Bingo_Center.2FResearch_Facility">Bingo center/Research facility</a>, which regularly unlocks new upgrades every 30 minutes, you will eventually get to an upgrade called “One Mind”. If you buy it, a warning will appear, and will start the <a href="https://cookieclicker.fandom.com/wiki/Grandmapocalypse">Grandmapocalypse</a>. We now need to expain wrath cookies, wrinklers, and shiny wrinklers.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=28 data-line-end=29 ><a id="Wrath_Cookies_28"></a>Wrath Cookies</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="29" data-line-end="30"><a href="https://cookieclicker.fandom.com/wiki/Wrath_Cookie">Wrath cookies</a> are like golden cookies, except that they (basically) have extra two negative effects, “Ruin”, which makes you lose cookies, and “Clot”, which halves CpS for 66 seconds. They look like this: <img src="https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/img/wrathCookie.png" alt="">. They (mostly) appear only in the grandmapocalypse.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=31 data-line-end=32 ><a id="Wrinklers_31"></a>Wrinklers</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="32" data-line-end="33">Wrinklers are objects that appear only in the grandmapocalypse. The decrease your CpS by eating your cookies, and you can pop them by clicking on them 3 times. But, they are actually good! When you pop them, they give back 1.1 times the number of cookies they ate from you. They look like this: <img src="https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/img/wrinkler.png" alt="">.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=34 data-line-end=35 ><a id="Shiny_Wrinklers_34"></a>Shiny Wrinklers</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="35" data-line-end="36">Shiny wrinlkers are very similar to normal wrinklers, except they are yellow, they give back 3.3 times the number of cookies they ate, and that they take 12 clicks to pop instead of the normal 3. When a wrinkler spawns, there is a 0.01% chance that it will be replaced with a shiny wrinlker. They look like this: <img src="https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/img/shinyWrinkler.png" alt="">.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="38" data-line-end="39">Back to the grandmapocalypse. Once you buy “One Mind”, you enter what is called the first stage of the grandmapocalypse. In the first stage, 33% of golden cookies are replaced with wrath cookies. Wrinklers will spawn. To get to the second phase, you buy the upgrades until you bought the “Communal Brainsweep” upgrade. Then, 66% of golden cookies are replaced by wrath cookies, and wrinklers will spawn faster. Then, when you buy “Elder Pact”, you will enter the third and final stage. All golden cookies will be replaced by wrath cookies, and wrinklers will spawn even faster.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="41" data-line-end="42">In the grandmapocalypse, meaty sugar lumps will appear. They appear more the later stage you go. When you get one, there is a 40% chance it gives nothing, a 20% chance it gives 1 sugar lump, and a 40% chance it gives 2.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="44" data-line-end="45">When you buy the heavenly upgrade “How to bake your dragon”, ascend, and get 1 million cookies, you can buy a <a href="https://cookieclicker.fandom.com/wiki/Krumblor">dragon egg</a> for 25 cookies. You can sacrifice cookies/buildings to train the dragon. Once it learned an aura, it can use it to make the game easier in some way. After you train the dragon more, it can learn two auras.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="50" data-line-end="51">The <a href="https://cookieclicker.fandom.com/wiki/Garden">garden</a> is unlocked by having level 1 farms. Higher level farms give more garden space. You can plant plants from seeds for some number of cookies. You start with one seed, the Baker’s Wheat seed. You have different types of soil you can choose from. They are unlocked by having a specific number of farms. All soil have a number called “tick every (number) minutes”. By planting a seed, you can wait for it to mature. The time it takes depends on the type of seed and the soil number. All plants start at a bud. That means their effect is at 10%. After, it will sprout, giving them a 25% effectiveness. It will become a bloom later, giving their plant effects 50% of what it should do, and then it will mature and have full plant effects. If you click (harvest) a mature plant and you do not yet have the corresponding seed, you will get the seed. You can use a sugar lump every 27 seconds to advance to the next tick and make the next tick a tick with 3 times spread and mutation rate.</p>

There are 3 slots: Diamond, Ruby, and Jade. There are 11 spirits. You start with 3 worship swaps. Slotting a spirit into a slot uses up a worship swap. If you slot a spirit, you will get both a positive effect and a negative effect. The effects varies for each spirit, and the intensity of the effects of a spirit change by putting it in different slots. The Diamond slot is the most intense effects, followed by Ruby and then Jade. If you have less that 3 worship swaps, the next one will refill after a couple of hours. You can use up a sugar lump every 27 seconds to refill all of your worship swaps.</p>

The loan slots works like loans in the real world. You get extra CpS for an amount of time, but later your CpS decreases, and you lose cookies.</p>
